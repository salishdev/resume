#     description: Ridiculously simple timer for your macOS menu-bar timer app that displays a radial visual countdown to help users better visualise elapsed and remaining time.
#     # url: https://salish.dev/apps/radtimer
#     # highlights:
#     #   - Developed a lightweight macOS menu-bar timer using Swift & SwiftUI to present a continuously updating radial visual countdown, enabling users to better visualise time passage and stay on track.
#     #   - Designed and implemented a feature-rich Pomodoro workflow (configurable work/break intervals) grounded in executive-function research (e.g., individuals with ADHD often struggle with time perception and “time blindness”)  [oai_citation:0‡PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6556068/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), increasing user engagement and self-regulation of tasks.
#     #   - Created a polished UX by integrating Core Animation (and optionally Metal/Quartz as needed) for smooth visual feedback in the menu bar, plus ensured low resource overhead (idle when inactive) — resulting in a productivity tool that blends into a developer’s workflow without distraction.
